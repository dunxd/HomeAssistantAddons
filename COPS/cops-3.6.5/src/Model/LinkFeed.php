 * An Acquisition Feed is an OPDS Catalog Feed Document that collects OPDS Catalog Entries
 * into a single, ordered set. The simplest complete OPDS Catalog would be a single Acquisition
 * Feed listing all of the available OPDS Catalog Entries from that provider. In more complex
 * OPDS Catalogs, Acquisition Feeds are used to present and organize sets of related OPDS
 * Catalog Entries for browsing and discovery by clients and aggregators.
 *
 * Links to Acquisition Feeds MUST use the "type" attribute
 *   "application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog;kind=acquisition"
