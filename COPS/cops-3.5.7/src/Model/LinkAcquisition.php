 * From https://drafts.opds.io/opds-2.0#53-acquisition-links
 * In OPDS 2.0, the concept of an Acquision Link is not as central as in OPDS 1.x
 * since publications can also be accessed through a manifest.
 * That said, for publications that are strictly accessible through a download
 * or require specific interactions, the concept remains.
